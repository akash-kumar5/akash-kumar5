# 👋 Hey, I’m Akash  
I build more side projects than side dishes I eat in a week.  
Currently deep into **legal AI** and **market intelligence**, building products that solve boring but high-impact problems.

---

## 🚀 What I’m Building

- ⚖️ **[Lexx](#)** — AI for legal drafting that turns boring notices into sharp, context-aware documents.  
- 📊 **[Market Regime Classifier](#)** — A real-time ML system that classifies market phases (trend, range, squeeze) and powers smarter trading logic.  

*(The classifier is part of a larger idea: **Dazai**, an AI that learns to trade like a retail trader — from mistakes to decisions.)*

## 🎯 What I’m Aiming For

- Build **AI systems that reason**, retrieve, and automate legal workflows.  
- Create **market intelligence tools** that bridge human psychology and machine precision.  
- Explore how **rule-based logic + LLM reasoning** can power autonomous decision-making.
